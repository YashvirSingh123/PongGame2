# Description
This project demonstrates the creation of a Pong game using Java's GUI libraries. The game is a modern take on the classic Pong game from the 1970s, featuring a unique twist in terms of style and design. The purpose of this project is to practice Java programming skills and showcase proficiency in working with Java GUI components to build an interactive game.



## Features

- Classic Pong gameplay with modern design.
- Player-controlled character for interactive gameplay.
- Stylish graphics and visual effects.
- Real-time collision detection and ball movement.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (place the file in the eclipse-workspace folder).
2. Open the project in Eclipse Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `GamePanel.java` file.
4. The game window will open, displaying the Pong game.
5. Use the keyboard arrow keys to control your characters.
6. When game over, a message will pop up and the game shuts down (by clicking the X on the top right)

## Concepts Used

- Java Programming Language
- Java Swing and AWT Libraries for GUI
- Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
- Event Handling and Listeners
- Collision Detection Algorithms

## Why This Project?

This project is designed to showcase my proficiency in Java programming, particularly in building interactive graphical user interfaces using Java's Swing and AWT libraries as well as demonstrate my understanding of object-oriented principles and event handling.

  
## Acknowledgments

- The classic Pong game concept was originally created by Atari, Inc. in the 1970s.
- The project design and code implementation are solely for educational and practice purposes.
